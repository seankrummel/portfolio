      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack web developer currently seeking employment. I studied
        Computer Science at Luther College before leaving to pursue Thinkful's
        Engineering Immersion bootcamp. I have experience using jQuerry or React
        on the front end and Node on the back end with an SQL or Mongo database
        and am eager to learn new technologies. Outside of programming I enjoy
        tabletop roll playing games as well as playing or watching soccer and
        ultimate frisbee.

        <p>
          Schnapsidee is a project I worked on in a pair. It uses a spaced
          repetition algorithm to teach German vocabulary. The algorithm uses a
          linked list, and because of limitations in the database we
          implemented the linked list using an array of objects (keys are the
          vocabulary and also the index of the next item). This project was an
          exercise in pair programming and creating algorithms so we only have
          six words programmed.

        <p>
          I worked on Game-A-Tron as part of a group of four developers. It's a
          tool to turn mundane tasks (e.g. chores) into games by assigning
          points to actions. We included an image upload system so that users
          could add images to their posts. Most of the time I spent on this
          project was working on the server side. I also implemented an email
          system using node-mailer that we used to verify new users. We used
          Agile development to keep ourselves organized.
