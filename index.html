      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full-stack web developer currently seeking employment. I studied
        Computer Science at Luther College before leaving to pursue Thinkful's
        Engineering Immersion bootcamp. I have experience using jQuerry or React
        on the front end and Node on the back end with an SQL or Mongo database
        and am eager to learn new technologies as well as work with and learn
        from a team of great developers. Outside of programming I enjoy tabletop
        role playing games as well as playing or watching soccer and ultimate
        frisbee.

          <img class="project-screenshot" src="./images/screenshotGameATron.jpg" alt="screenshot"/>
          <p>
            I worked on Game-A-Tron as part of a group of four developers. It's
            a tool to turn mundane tasks (e.g. chores) into games by assigning
            points to actions. We included an image upload system so that users
            could add images to their posts. Most of the time I spent on this
            project was working on the server side. I also implemented an email
            system using node-mailer that we used to verify new users. We used
            Agile development to keep ourselves organized.

          <img class="project-screenshot" src="./images/screenshotSchnapsidee.jpg" alt="screenshot"/>
          <p>
            Schnapsidee is a project I worked on in a pair. It uses a spaced
            repetition algorithm to teach German vocabulary. The algorithm uses
            a linked list, and because of limitations in the database we
            implemented the linked list using an array of objects (keys are the
            vocabulary and also the index of the next item). This project was an
            exercise in pair programming and creating algorithms so we only have
            six words in the database.

          <img class="project-screenshot" src="./images/screenshotRecipeApp.jpg" alt="screenshot"/>
          <p>
            This is a very simple MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) app that I
            developed during my time studying at Thinkful. It is for creating
            and saving recipes, and was an exercise for me to learn how to use
            React and have it communicate with a server. I was the sole
            developer on this project.
